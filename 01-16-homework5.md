## Individual Assignment #2

For the second individual assignment, you will be comparing results from Monte Carlo simulations to tabulatd experimental values reported by NIST. [Click this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/EyklTlS7) to start the assignment. There is a detailed explanation in the associated Jupyter notebook.

## NumPy Monte Carlo

Take an hour or so to discuss with your teammates what changes you can make to your code to take advantage of the features of NumPy arrays. For this portion, take the first 30 minutes to think about this by yourself, then discuss for half an hour with your group. We will tell you one option for rewriting your code at the end of this discussion period.
